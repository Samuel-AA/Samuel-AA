My interest in becoming a data scientist has grown more during my industrial training at the Lagos bureau of statistics where I participated in several surveys organised by the state bureau of statistics, such as Lagos state 2016 household surveys and GDP for 2016 and 2018. Using some statistical tools such as SPSS and R programming language while computing and analysing the data gotten from the surveys. It is an interest that continues to this day.
